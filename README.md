# Quora Semantic Search with Sentence Transformers and Pinecone

This project demonstrates how to build a **semantic search engine** using sentence embeddings, vector similarity, and Pinecone. It leverages the **Quora Questions dataset** and the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from the `sentence-transformers` library.

> 💡 Originally created as part of a course project at Cairo University.
